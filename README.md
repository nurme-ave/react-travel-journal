## Overview

### Project Description

This was a dynamic data-driven React solo project at the Scrimba's Frontend Development Bootcamp. Solo project means that you are only provided with a set of requirements you need to implement in the project. There is no hand-holding or a walk-through solution with the instructor and you're on your own.

Features I added myself:
- I set up the React development environment with Create React App (version 18.1.0) on my own computer. This was not actually a requirement as Scrimba has its own environment which is already set up but I've always preferred to use my own local setup to get more practice.
- added a favicon

New things learned:
- the JSX syntax
- custom components
- props
- display data dynamically

The page has been built with mobile-first design in mind and is fully responsive.

The code has been reviewed and approved by a Scrimba instructor.
