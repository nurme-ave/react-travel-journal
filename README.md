## Overview

### Project Description

This was my first data-driven React project where I learned about the JSX syntax, custom components, props and how to display data dynamically in React.

I also imported icons from Font Awesome for this project and found out that doing this in React is slightly different than how I was used to doing it in JavaScript.

The data is stored in a separate data.js file as an array of objects. Each of the objects has an ID, title, Google Maps URL, travel time, short description and the image URL property.

I have 3 components here: Header, Card & Footer. I'm passing the object into the Card component as a prop, destructuring this and then displaying all the data on the page for each card (travel destination).

The page has been built with mobile-first design in mind and is fully responsive.
